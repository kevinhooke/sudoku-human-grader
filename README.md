# Sudoku Puzzle Human Grader
This is an attempt to build a Sudoku puzzle grader that applies solving techniques
to determine the relative difficulty of the puzzle.

The intial starting point of this solver is my first attempt to build a solver
because that also used a human solver approach. You can see that project here:

For a more effective solver, see my Algorithm X with Dancing Links solver,
